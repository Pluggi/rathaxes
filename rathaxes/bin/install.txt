Rathaxes Installation:
----------------------


Hi there, sorry for these too few lines, a better version of this file will come
soon with an installer for each operating system Rathaxes can generate C code for.
Today, there's only a unix shell script that can run the monster, feel free to
edit it for fiting your needs or write or new one for windows shells.
Here's guideline to write it:


The CodeWorker engine takes a lot of arguments to run Rathaxes.
first, set you installation path, it will be the prefix of all other paths.
Some include paths must be set to the CodeWorker engine, they are the following:
(use your os path separator instead of '/' if needed...)

- install_path/scripts/generation/
- install_path/scripts/misc/
- install_path/scripts/parsing/
- install_path/scripts/semantics/
- install_path/scripts/cnorm/
- install_path/scripts/../black_library/

then run the CodeWorker engine with the following command line respecting the arguments order:

codeworker -nologo -stack 1000 [-I include_path_1 -I include_path_2 ...] [-script your_installed_path/scripts/rathaxes.cws] [-args ["unix" | "windows"] "your_installed_path" any_file.rtx]


If needed refer to the unix shell script 'rathaxes' in this folder.


    THOR.
