## Error/Log system for the compiler ##

Actually, the way the compiler prints languages error to user is very basic.
Our language uses a complex template resolution pattern to process C code, so it's more and more difficult to understand raising errors.So we need a centralized library to handle error and log. It's a good way for beginner to enter into the project.

We really need more developer in our core team, so this Gsoc is also a good way to recruit new members.
